                    <p>One problem was getting the endpoint url as we had no idea how to get the url to work. We figured out that we needed a
                      number generator to choose a random comic but didn't really know how to get that to work. We tried to do some psuedocode
                      to help understand what we wanted to do and it helped us get some code down.
