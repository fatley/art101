			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function that does a math equation with one parameter, 'x'.
						After that, we are going to create an array of numbers to use the map() function to alter our array. 
						After that, we create another function to play with the array.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Some problems that came up was just not knowing what functions JavaScript already has. 
						I had to do some research on which function I can call to perform the task we wanted it to.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went pretty well because we went over it during class and also there are many great examples of
						JavaScript functions and how to use them on the internet.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id ="output">
						<p>the array, the square root, and squared:</p>
