					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Some problems that arose during this lab was trying to get the button to generate a random text that was
						short or long to mimic that of a real conversation between people. In addition, I wanted to play around with
						the CSS to mimic that of a iMessage conversation by having it change from blue and white.  
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Press the button below to start the conversation!
