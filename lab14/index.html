					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to debug any errors of our previous labs. Due to the lack of debugging we needed to do,
						we decided to try our hand at Task X: Bonus by adding breakpoints via console.log and then trying to answer
						some questions on Stackoverflow.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We found the lab to be relatively easy and did not have any labs to debug however, we decided to add breakpoints
						so that we can see our code running correctly. We also decided to answer some questions in Stackoverflow.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div id="output">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We decided to help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77515397/why-cannot-i-print-the-data-inside-a-div-container answer their question.

				<h2>Debugging</h2>
				<p>We did not have any lab that needed debugging so we decided to proceed to Task X.
					Answer: To display the array data within the div container, you would have to target the div by its "id". 
					For example, whereever you are displaying the joke, add an id attribute to the div. So it could look like this:
					div class="minor-section" id="jokes". Then in the JavaScript file, you would have to replace "jokes-result" with "jokes" inside the getElementbyId() function.
					So it would look like this instead, "document.getElementById("jokes").innerHTML = "Joke For Today is: " + b + " Joke Number: " + a;"
