						This assignment was like a breathe of fresh air for me. I am taking 3 different programming classes right now and they are in three different
						langauges. While I was initializing the variables, I assumed it was going to be the easiest part of the lab, however
						I made a slight error which caused my Javascript code not to show up on my website. After 3 days of pondering, I finally
						realized that it was a missing quotation mark which is a very simple mistake. After finding out what the problem was, 
						I just had a moment of realization and laughed at myself.
