					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here. The challenge of this lab was to learn and practice 
						data type and variables in Javascript.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? One of the small problems that I ran into was forgetting
						to include a semi colon (;) after initializing the variables in javascript. The Javascript console kept
						returning unidentified after I would try to, however, I quickly figured it out. I was just used to python
						and would forget to add the semi colon at the end of each line.
