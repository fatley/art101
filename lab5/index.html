                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Restate the challenge of the lab here. The challenge of this lab was to learn and practice 
                        data type and variables in Javascript.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? One of the small problems that I ran into was forgetting
                        to include a semi colon (;) after initializing the variables in javascript. The Javascript console kept
                        returning unidentified after I would try to, however, I quickly figured it out. I was just used to python
                        and would forget to add the semi colon at the end of each line.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? 
						This assignment was like a breathe of fresh air for me. I am taking 3 different programming classes right now and they are in three different
						langauges. While I was initializing the variables, I assumed it was going to be the easiest part of the lab, however
						I made a slight error which caused my Javascript code not to show up on my website. After 3 days of pondering, I finally
						realized that it was a missing quotation mark which is a very simple mistake. After finding out what the problem was, 
						I just had a moment of realization and laughed at myself.
